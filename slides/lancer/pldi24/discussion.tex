\section{Discussion}

We have presented data structures, algorithms, and optimizations for
deciding \NetKAT equivalence. Our experience suggests the approach
based on computing bisimulations via weakest preconditions generally
performs best, but it would be interesting to further investigate
combinations of the approaches and give a more precise
characterization in terms of topologies, configurations, and
verification queries. In general, a verification tool might do well to
select an appropriate algorithm based on heuristics about the
expressions involved.

Another avenue for future work involves the data structure used to
represent $\todoR$ in \Cref{fig:pseudocode} and \Cref{fig:wp-alg},
which was intentionally left abstract. By picking different data
structures, these algorithms may be instantiated using depth-first,
breadth-first, or other traversals the same way as with classic graph
search.
