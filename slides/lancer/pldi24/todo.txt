Writing
=======

* Replace FDD with SPP

* Rip out WP entirely?

* Combine grab bag sections into new single Implementation section

* Iterate on Related Work

Implemenation/Evaluation
========================

* Test forward and backward

* Run frenetic

* Produce tables / graphs

* Do reachability check more efficiently
    - n-wise or single check instead of n x n queries

* Visualization

* Run other queries (unreachability, slicing) or other topologies (Stanford,
  generated fat trees)
